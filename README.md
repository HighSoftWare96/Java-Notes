# <h1> Java-Notes </h1>
Java application for create notes and reminders inspired to Sticky Notes of Microsoft Windows.
This simple cross-platform application, developed in Java, allows to create notes and reminders that will appear
on the desktop just like the Sticky Notes app. All the notes written will be saved in the file with path %APPDATA%\JNotes\notes.jnotes
with the Java serialization. With some default themes you can create notes with different colors and patterns, and every note can have a
little descriptive title on it.

On this <a href="https://github.com/HighSoftWare96/Java-Notes/blob/master/JNotes.jar">link</a> you can download the final runnable application for everyday use (obviously it's raccomanded the <a href="https://www.java.com/it/download/">JRE installation</a>).
